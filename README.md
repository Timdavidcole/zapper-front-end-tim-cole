# Team List Tech test

## About

Nice little tech test I did for a Zappar application.  Pretty happy with it as I don't usually use vanilla Javascript these days, and I've never used Typescript.  Typescript is fantastic for debugging and getting your thoughts ordered as you code.

Only thing I might change is to create some proper custom components for the elements, although this might be overkill for a project this small.

## Tech Stack

* HTML5 Boilerplate (bare bones project template)
* Javascript (ES6)
* Typescript
* Jasmine (unit tests)
* Cypress (feature tests)

## Usage

### Install
```
git clone 
cd zapper-front-end-tech-test
npm install
```
### To run tests
```
npm test (for feature tests)
open SpecRunner.html (for unit tests)
